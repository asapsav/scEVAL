Certainly, here's a simplified example that sketches out what a dependent type theory formalization might look like for a very basic scRNA-seq pipeline in a language inspired by Lean. The example will just focus on a couple of steps for illustration: quality control (QC) and alignment. Note that this is extremely simplified and abstract.

First, let's define some basic types:

```lean
-- Let's assume GeneID and CellID are represented as natural numbers
def GeneID := ℕ
def CellID := ℕ

-- Raw count for a given gene in a given cell
def Count := ℕ

-- A single cell's RNA-seq data can be represented as a mapping from GeneID to Count
def SingleCellData := GeneID → Count

-- scRNA-seq data is a mapping from CellID to SingleCellData
def ScRNASeqData := CellID → SingleCellData
```

Now, let's consider quality control. A simple QC step might remove all cells that have fewer than `n` counts.

```lean
-- A dependent type for a minimum count threshold
def MinCount := ℕ

-- Quality control function type: It takes ScRNASeqData and a MinCount,
-- and returns ScRNASeqData that only includes cells with at least MinCount total counts.
def QualityControl : ScRNASeqData → MinCount → ScRNASeqData := ...
```

For alignment, let's assume we have a reference genome, represented as a mapping from GeneID to some sequence.

```lean
def Sequence := string
def ReferenceGenome := GeneID → Sequence

-- Alignment function: Takes ScRNASeqData and a ReferenceGenome,
-- returns ScRNASeqData where the counts are aligned to the ReferenceGenome.
def Align : ScRNASeqData → ReferenceGenome → ScRNASeqData := ...
```

Finally, you could define a type for a pipeline that performs these steps in sequence.

```lean
def BasicPipeline (rawData: ScRNASeqData) (refGenome: ReferenceGenome) (minCount: MinCount) : ScRNASeqData :=
  let qcData := QualityControl rawData minCount in
  Align qcData refGenome
```

This is a very basic outline, but hopefully it gives you an idea of how one might begin to formalize an scRNA-seq pipeline using dependent types. One could add additional dependent types to capture more complex constraints, add formal proofs of properties, etc.
